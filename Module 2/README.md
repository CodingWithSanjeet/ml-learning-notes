## Lecture 1: Model Representation

### What is Supervised Learning? (Recap)

### 🎯 Quick Reminder
**Supervised Learning** = Learning with a teacher who has the answer key

- We train a model using data where we **already know the correct answers** (labels)
- **Goal**: Learn the relationship between input (X) and output (Y)
- **Purpose**: Make accurate predictions on new, unseen data

### 🎭 Two Main Types

| **Type** | **Predicts** | **Example** | **Output** |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Regression** 📊 | Continuous values | House prices | $245,673.21 |
| **Classification** 🏷️ | Discrete categories | Email type | Spam or Not Spam |

### 💡 Think of it Like This
- **Regression**: "How much?" (any number)
- **Classification**: "Which category?" (fixed options)

---

### Introduction to Linear Regression

### 🏠 Real-World Example: Predicting House Prices

Let's use a concrete example that everyone can relate to!

#### 📍 The Scenario
You're helping a friend figure out how much their house might be worth in **Portland, Oregon**.

#### 📊 The Data
- **Input (X)**: Size of the house in square feet
- **Output (Y)**: Price of the house in dollars

#### 🎯 The Question
*"If my friend's house is 1,250 sq ft, what should I expect it to cost?"*

#### 🔮 The Goal
Build a model that can predict house prices based on size, so you can give your friend a reasonable estimate.

### 🧠 Why This is Regression
- House prices can be **any number**: $245,673.21, $245,673.22, etc.
- We're predicting a **continuous value**, not choosing from fixed categories
- The price smoothly increases/decreases with house size

---

### Training Set & Notation

### 📚 What is a Training Set?
The **training set** is the collection of examples we use to teach our algorithm.

Think of it like a **textbook with answer sheets** - it contains both questions (house sizes) and correct answers (actual prices).

### 🏠 Example Training Set
Let's say we collected data on **47 houses** in Portland:

| House # | Size (sq ft) | Price |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | 2,104 | $460,000 |
| 2 | 1,416 | $232,000 |
| 3 | 1,534 | $315,000 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 47 | 852 | $178,000 |

### 📝 Mathematical Notation

Understanding the "language" of machine learning:

| **Symbol** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **m** | Number of training examples | m = 47 (we have 47 houses) |
| **x** | Input feature | x = house size in sq ft |
| **y** | Output label | y = price in dollars |
| **(x⁽ⁱ⁾, y⁽ⁱ⁾)** | The i-th training example | (x⁽¹⁾, y⁽¹⁾) = (2,104 sq ft, $460,000) |

### 🎯 Reading the Notation
- **(x⁽¹⁾, y⁽¹⁾)** = First house: 2,104 sq ft, costs $460,000
- **(x⁽²⁾, y⁽²⁾)** = Second house: 1,416 sq ft, costs $232,000
- **(x⁽⁴⁷⁾, y⁽⁴⁷⁾)** = 47th house: 852 sq ft, costs $178,000

> **Note**: The superscript (i) refers to the example number, not exponentiation!

### How the Learning Algorithm Works

### 🔄 The Learning Process

Think of this like teaching someone to estimate house prices:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["📚 Training Set<br/>(Houses with sizes & prices)"] --> B["🧠 Learning Algorithm<br/>(Finds patterns in data)"]
    B --> C["🔮 Hypothesis Function<br/>h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x"]
    D["🏠 Size of house<br/>(x)"] --> C
    C --> E["💰 Estimated price<br/>(predicted value of y)"]
    
    subgraph "Linear Regression Process"
        F["h maps from x's to y's"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style E fill:#fff8e1
```

### 🎯 Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Feed Training Data** 📊
- Show the algorithm 47 houses with their sizes and actual prices
- Algorithm studies the relationship between size and price

#### 2. **Find the Pattern** 🔍
- Algorithm notices: "Bigger houses tend to cost more"
- Discovers the mathematical relationship between size and price

#### 3. **Create Predictor Function** 🔮
- Algorithm creates a function `h(x)` (called "hypothesis")
- This function can predict price for any house size

#### 4. **Make Predictions** 🎯
- Input: New house size (1,250 sq ft)
- Output: Predicted price (~$220,000)

### 💡 Real-Life Analogy
It's like learning to estimate pizza prices:
- You observe many pizza shops (training data)
- You notice patterns: bigger pizzas cost more
- You develop a mental formula: "12-inch pizza ≈ $15, 16-inch ≈ $20"
- Now you can estimate the price of any pizza size

### The Hypothesis Function

### 🎯 What is a Hypothesis?
The **hypothesis** is our prediction function - it's the "brain" that makes predictions.

For linear regression, it's represented as:

### 📐 The Mathematical Formula

```
h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x
```

### 🧩 Understanding the Components

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Hypothesis Function"
        A["h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Components"
        B["θ₀<br/>Intercept<br/>(y-axis crossing)"]
        C["θ₁<br/>Slope<br/>(rate of change)"]
        D["x<br/>Input<br/>(house size)"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Visual Representation"
        E["📈 Straight Line<br/>through data points"]
    end
    
    B --> A
    C --> A
    D --> A
    A --> E
    
    style A fill:#fff3e0
    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#f3e5f5
    style E fill:#fff8e1
```

### 🧩 Breaking Down the Formula

| **Component** | **Name** | **What it Does** | **House Price Example** |
|---------------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **θ₀** (theta zero) | **Intercept** | Starting point of the line | Base price: $50,000 |
| **θ₁** (theta one) | **Slope** | How much y changes per unit of x | +$150 per sq ft |
| **x** | **Input** | The feature we're using | House size: 1,250 sq ft |
| **h_θ(x)** | **Prediction** | The output prediction | Predicted price |

### 🏠 Example Calculation

Let's say our algorithm learned:
- **θ₀ = 50,000** (base price)
- **θ₁ = 150** (price per sq ft)

For a 1,250 sq ft house:
```
h_θ(1250) = 50,000 + 150 × 1,250
h_θ(1250) = 50,000 + 187,500
h_θ(1250) = $237,500
```

### 📈 Visualizing the Line - Univariate Linear Regression Example

The hypothesis creates a **straight line** through your data:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Linear Regression Chart"
        A["🏠 House Size (sq ft)<br/>1400 → 3000"]
        B["💰 Price ($1000s)<br/>200 → 550"]
        C["📊 Training Data Points<br/>(Blue X marks)"]
        D["📈 Hypothesis Line<br/>h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x<br/>(Red line)"]
    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    
    style A fill:#e8f5e8
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#e1f5fe
    style D fill:#ffebee
```

**Key Elements:**
- 🔵 **Blue X marks**: Training Data (actual house prices)
- 🔴 **Red line**: Hypothesis h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x (best fit line)
- 📊 **Linear relationship**: As house size increases, price increases proportionally
- 🎯 **Goal**: Line minimizes distance to all data points

```

**h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x** (Shorthand: **h(x)**)

**Component Breakdown:**
- **θ₀** = y-intercept (base price when size = 0)
- **θ₁** = slope (price increase per sq ft)  
- **x** = house size (input)
- **h(x)** = predicted price (output)

**Visual Representation:**
```
Price ($) 
    ↑
    │        ×  ← Data points (actual house prices)
    │      ×   ×
    │    ×       ×
    │  ×           ×  
    │×     /         ×   ← Line: h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x
    │    /             
    │  /                
    │/____________________→ Size (sq ft)
   θ₀ (y-intercept)
   
h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x
Shorthand: h(x)
```

### 🎯 Why It's Called "Linear"
- Creates a **straight line** (not curved)
- Relationship between x and y is **linear** (proportional)

### 📛 Technical Name
**Univariate Linear Regression**
- **Uni** = One
- **Variate** = Variable  
- **Linear** = Straight line
- **Regression** = Predicting continuous values

Translation: "Using one variable to predict continuous values with a straight line"
