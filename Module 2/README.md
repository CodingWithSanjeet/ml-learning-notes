## Lecture 1: Model Representation

### What is Supervised Learning? (Recap)

### 🎯 Quick Reminder
**Supervised Learning** = Learning with a teacher who has the answer key

- We train a model using data where we **already know the correct answers** (labels)
- **Goal**: Learn the relationship between input (X) and output (Y)
- **Purpose**: Make accurate predictions on new, unseen data

### 🎭 Two Main Types

| **Type** | **Predicts** | **Example** | **Output** |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Regression** 📊 | Continuous values | House prices | $245,673.21 |
| **Classification** 🏷️ | Discrete categories | Email type | Spam or Not Spam |

### 💡 Think of it Like This
- **Regression**: "How much?" (any number)
- **Classification**: "Which category?" (fixed options)

---

### Introduction to Linear Regression

### 🏠 Real-World Example: Predicting House Prices

Let's use a concrete example that everyone can relate to!

#### 📍 The Scenario
You're helping a friend figure out how much their house might be worth in **Portland, Oregon**.

#### 📊 The Data
- **Input (X)**: Size of the house in square feet
- **Output (Y)**: Price of the house in dollars

#### 🎯 The Question
*"If my friend's house is 1,250 sq ft, what should I expect it to cost?"*

#### 🔮 The Goal
Build a model that can predict house prices based on size, so you can give your friend a reasonable estimate.

### 🧠 Why This is Regression
- House prices can be **any number**: $245,673.21, $245,673.22, etc.
- We're predicting a **continuous value**, not choosing from fixed categories
- The price smoothly increases/decreases with house size

---

### Training Set & Notation

### 📚 What is a Training Set?
The **training set** is the collection of examples we use to teach our algorithm.

Think of it like a **textbook with answer sheets** - it contains both questions (house sizes) and correct answers (actual prices).

### 🏠 Example Training Set
Let's say we collected data on **47 houses** in Portland:

| House # | Size (sq ft) | Price |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | 2,104 | $460,000 |
| 2 | 1,416 | $232,000 |
| 3 | 1,534 | $315,000 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 47 | 852 | $178,000 |

### 📝 Mathematical Notation

Understanding the "language" of machine learning:

| **Symbol** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **m** | Number of training examples | m = 47 (we have 47 houses) |
| **x** | Input feature | x = house size in sq ft |
| **y** | Output label | y = price in dollars |
| **(x⁽ⁱ⁾, y⁽ⁱ⁾)** | The i-th training example | (x⁽¹⁾, y⁽¹⁾) = (2,104 sq ft, $460,000) |

### 🎯 Reading the Notation
- **(x⁽¹⁾, y⁽¹⁾)** = First house: 2,104 sq ft, costs $460,000
- **(x⁽²⁾, y⁽²⁾)** = Second house: 1,416 sq ft, costs $232,000
- **(x⁽⁴⁷⁾, y⁽⁴⁷⁾)** = 47th house: 852 sq ft, costs $178,000

> **Note**: The superscript (i) refers to the example number, not exponentiation!

### How the Learning Algorithm Works

### 🔄 The Learning Process

Think of this like teaching someone to estimate house prices:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["📚 Training Set<br/>(Houses with sizes & prices)"] --> B["🧠 Learning Algorithm<br/>(Finds patterns in data)"]
    B --> C["🔮 Hypothesis Function<br/>h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x"]
    D["🏠 Size of house<br/>(x)"] --> C
    C --> E["💰 Estimated price<br/>(predicted value of y)"]
    
    subgraph "Linear Regression Process"
        F["h maps from x's to y's"]
    end

    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style E fill:#fff8e1
```

### 🎯 Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Feed Training Data** 📊
- Show the algorithm 47 houses with their sizes and actual prices
- Algorithm studies the relationship between size and price

#### 2. **Find the Pattern** 🔍
- Algorithm notices: "Bigger houses tend to cost more"
- Discovers the mathematical relationship between size and price

#### 3. **Create Predictor Function** 🔮
- Algorithm creates a function `h(x)` (called "hypothesis")
- This function can predict price for any house size

#### 4. **Make Predictions** 🎯
- Input: New house size (1,250 sq ft)
- Output: Predicted price (~$220,000)

### 💡 Real-Life Analogy
It's like learning to estimate pizza prices:
- You observe many pizza shops (training data)
- You notice patterns: bigger pizzas cost more
- You develop a mental formula: "12-inch pizza ≈ $15, 16-inch ≈ $20"
- Now you can estimate the price of any pizza size

---

### The Hypothesis Function

### 🎯 What is a Hypothesis?
The **hypothesis** is our prediction function - it's the "brain" that makes predictions.

For linear regression, it's represented as:

### 📐 The Mathematical Formula

```
h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x
```

### 🧩 Understanding the Components

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Hypothesis Function"
        A["h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Components"

        C["θ₁<br/>Slope<br/>(rate of change)"]
        D["x<br/>Input<br/>(house size)"]
    end

    end

    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#f3e5f5
    style E fill:#fff8e1
```

### 🧩 Breaking Down the Formula

| **Component** | **Name** | **What it Does** | **House Price Example** |
|---------------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **θ₀** (theta zero) | **Intercept** | Starting point of the line | Base price: $50,000 |
| **θ₁** (theta one) | **Slope** | How much y changes per unit of x | +$150 per sq ft |
| **x** | **Input** | The feature we're using | House size: 1,250 sq ft |
| **h_θ(x)** | **Prediction** | The output prediction | Predicted price |

### 🏠 Example Calculation

Let's say our algorithm learned:
- **θ₀ = 50,000** (base price)
- **θ₁ = 150** (price per sq ft)

For a 1,250 sq ft house:
```
h_θ(1250) = 50,000 + 150 × 1,250
h_θ(1250) = 50,000 + 187,500
h_θ(1250) = $237,500
```

### 📈 Visualizing the Line - Univariate Linear Regression Example

The hypothesis creates a **straight line** through your data:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Linear Regression Chart"
        A["🏠 House Size (sq ft)<br/>1400 → 3000"]
        B["💰 Price ($1000s)<br/>200 → 550"]
        C["📊 Training Data Points<br/>(Blue X marks)"]
        D["📈 Hypothesis Line<br/>h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x<br/>(Red line)"]

**h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x** (Shorthand: **h(x)**)

**Component Breakdown:**
- **θ₀** = y-intercept (base price when size = 0)
- **θ₁** = slope (price increase per sq ft)  
- **x** = house size (input)
- **h(x)** = predicted price (output)

### 🎯 Why It's Called "Linear"
- Creates a **straight line** (not curved)
- Relationship between x and y is **linear** (proportional)

### 📛 Technical Name
**Univariate Linear Regression**
- **Uni** = One
- **Variate** = Variable  
- **Linear** = Straight line
- **Regression** = Predicting continuous values

Translation: "Using one variable to predict continuous values with a straight line"

## Lecture 2: Cost Function

Now that we understand what a hypothesis function is, the big question becomes: **How do we choose the best values for θ₀ and θ₁?** This is where the cost function comes in!

### 🎯 The Big Picture

In Lecture 1, we learned that our hypothesis is:
**h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x**

But we never answered: How do we find the best θ₀ and θ₁ values? Lecture 2 solves this fundamental problem.

### Understanding Parameters

#### 📊 Our Training Set (Real Example)

Let's look at our housing data with m = 47 training examples:

| **Size in feet² (x)** | **Price ($) in 1000's (y)** |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2104 | 460 |
| 1416 | 232 |
| 1534 | 315 |
| 852 | 178 |
| ... | ... |

*Note: m = 47 means we have 47 house examples in our training set*

#### 🔧 Parameters are the "Knobs" We Can Turn

Think of θ₀ and θ₁ as **adjustment knobs** on our prediction machine:

- **θ₀ (theta zero)**: The **intercept** - where the line crosses the y-axis
- **θ₁ (theta one)**: The **slope** - how steep the line is

**The Question**: Which settings of these "knobs" give us the best predictions?

### The Parameter Problem

#### 🎛️ Different Parameter Values = Different Lines

Let's see what happens when we change our parameters:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Parameter Effects on Hypothesis Function"
        A["θ₀ = 1.5, θ₁ = 0<br/>→ h(x) = 1.5<br/>(Horizontal line at y=1.5)"]
        B["θ₀ = 0, θ₁ = 0.5<br/>→ h(x) = 0.5x<br/>(Line through origin)"]
        C["θ₀ = 1, θ₁ = 0.5<br/>→ h(x) = 1 + 0.5x<br/>(Sloped line with y-intercept at 1)"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ffebee
    style B fill:#e8f5e8
    style C fill:#e1f5fe
```

#### 📈 Visual Examples

![Parameter Examples](images/parameter_examples_chart.png)

*How different θ₀ and θ₁ values create completely different hypothesis functions*

**Example 1**: θ₀ = 1.5, θ₁ = 0
```
h(x) = 1.5 + 0×x = 1.5
```
This gives us a **flat horizontal line** at y = 1.5 (no matter what house size, we always predict $1,500)

**Example 2**: θ₀ = 0, θ₁ = 0.5  
```
h(x) = 0 + 0.5×x = 0.5x
```
This gives us a **line through the origin** that goes up 0.5 for every 1 unit of x

**Example 3**: θ₀ = 1, θ₁ = 0.5
```
h(x) = 1 + 0.5×x
```
This gives us a **sloped line** starting at y = 1 and going up 0.5 for every 1 unit of x

#### 🤔 The Core Problem

**With infinite possible values for θ₀ and θ₁, how do we pick the BEST ones?**

We need a way to measure "how good" our line fits the data. This is where the **cost function** comes to the rescue!

### What is a Cost Function?

#### 💡 The Basic Idea

**Goal**: Choose θ₀ and θ₁ so that h_θ(x) is close to y for our training examples.

Think of it like this:
- You have actual house prices (y values)
- Your hypothesis makes predictions (h_θ(x) values)  
- A **cost function** measures how far off your predictions are

#### 🎯 The Intuitive Approach

    style D fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#ffebee
```

![Cost Function Visualization](images/cost_function_visualization.png)

*The cost function measures how far our predictions are from the actual values*

**For each house in our training set:**
1. **Input**: House size x⁽ⁱ⁾
2. **Prediction**: h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = θ₀ + θ₁x⁽ⁱ⁾
3. **Reality**: Actual price y⁽ⁱ⁾  
4. **Error**: How far off we were = |h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾|

### Squared Error Cost Function

#### 🧮 The Mathematical Formula

**We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function.** This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.

The **cost function J(θ₀, θ₁)** measures the total "badness" of our parameter choices:

```
J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²
```

**Alternative notation you might see:**
```
J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²
```
Where ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ = h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) (predicted value)

Let's break this down piece by piece:

#### 🧩 Breaking Down the Formula

| **Component** | **Meaning** | **Why It's There** |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾)** | Our prediction for house i | This is what our model thinks |
| **y⁽ⁱ⁾** | Actual price of house i | This is the truth |
| **h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾** | Prediction error for house i | How wrong we were |
| **[...]²** | Square the error | Makes all errors positive, penalizes big errors more |
| **Σ(i=1 to m)** | Sum over all houses | Add up errors from all training examples |
| **1/2m** | Divide by 2×(number of examples) | Get average error, 1/2 makes math easier later |

#### 🤔 Why Do We Divide by 1/2m? (Beginner Explanation)

This is one of the most confusing parts for beginners! Let's break it down step by step:

**Step 1: Why divide by 'm'?**
- **m** = number of training examples (houses in our dataset)
- We want the **average** error, not the total error
- If we don't divide by m, having more data would always make our cost bigger
- **Example**: 10 houses with $5k average error vs 1000 houses with $5k average error
  - Without dividing: Total errors would be 10×$5k = $50k vs 1000×$5k = $5M
  - After dividing by m: Both give average error of $5k ✅

**Step 2: Why the extra 1/2?**
This is a **mathematical convenience** for calculus (don't worry if this seems advanced):

**The Simple Answer**: It makes the math cleaner when we later find the minimum of this function.

**The Technical Answer**: 
```
d/dx (x²) = 2x
```
When we take the derivative of the squared term, we get a factor of 2. The 1/2 cancels this out, making our final equations simpler.

**Think of it like this**: 
- **(1/m)** = "Give me the average error"  
- **(1/2)** = "Make the math easier for finding the minimum"
- **Combined (1/2m)** = "Give me half the average squared error"

**Important**: The 1/2 doesn't change which θ₀ and θ₁ values are best! It just makes the numbers smaller and the math cleaner.

#### 🎯 Why Square the Errors?

**1. Makes All Errors Positive**
- If we predict $250k and actual is $300k: error = -$50k
- If we predict $350k and actual is $300k: error = +$50k  
- Without squaring, these cancel out! Squaring fixes this.

**2. Penalizes Big Errors More**
- Small error (10k): 10² = 100
- Big error (50k): 50² = 2,500  
- We want to avoid really bad predictions!

**3. Mathematical Convenience**
- Squared functions are smooth and easy to minimize
- No absolute value signs to worry about

#### 🏠 Concrete Example

Let's say we have 3 houses:

| House | Size (x) | Actual Price (y) | Our Prediction h_θ(x) | Error | Error² |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 1000 | $200k | $180k | -$20k | $400k² |
| 2 | 2000 | $400k | $380k | -$20k | $400k² |  
| 3 | 1500 | $300k | $320k | +$20k | $400k² |

```
J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1/2×3) × (400 + 400 + 400) = (1/6) × 1200 = 200
```

### Mathematical Formulation

#### 📝 The Complete Cost Function

**Formal Definition**:
```
J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²
```

Where:
- **h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = θ₀ + θ₁x⁽ⁱ⁾** (our hypothesis function)
- **m** = number of training examples
- **(x⁽ⁱ⁾, y⁽ⁱ⁾)** = i-th training example

#### 🎯 Our Goal (Optimization Problem)

```
minimize J(θ₀, θ₁)
θ₀, θ₁
```

**Translation**: Find the values of θ₀ and θ₁ that make the cost function as small as possible.

```

#### 🧠 Intuitive Understanding

**Think of the cost function as a "goodness meter":**
- **Low cost** = Our line fits the data well (good parameters!)
- **High cost** = Our line fits the data poorly (bad parameters!)

**The Process:**
1. **Try different θ₀ and θ₁ values**
2. **For each combination, calculate J(θ₀, θ₁)**  
3. **Find the combination that gives the lowest cost**
4. **Those are our best parameters!**

### 📚 Alternative Names

The cost function has several names you might encounter:

- **Cost Function** ✅ (most common)
- **Squared Error Function** ✅ (instructor's term)
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ✅ (very common)
- **Squared Error Cost Function**  
- **Loss Function**
- **Objective Function**

**From the instructor**: *"This function is otherwise called the 'Squared error function', or 'Mean squared error'."*

#### 🧮 Breaking Down "Mean Squared Error"

Let's understand this term piece by piece:

```
J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²
```

**To break it apart, it is (1/2) × x̄ where x̄ is the mean of the squares of h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾**, or the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

- **Mean**: We're averaging (Σ divided by m)
- **Squared**: We square each error ([ ]²)  
- **Error**: We measure prediction mistakes (h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)
- **1/2**: Mathematical convenience for gradient descent

They all refer to the same concept!

### 🤔 Why This Particular Cost Function?

#### ✅ **Advantages of Squared Error**

1. **Widely Used**: Works well for most regression problems
2. **Mathematical Properties**: Smooth, differentiable, easy to minimize
3. **Interpretable**: Directly measures prediction accuracy
4. **Proven**: Decades of successful applications
5. **Gradient Descent Friendly**: The 1/2 term makes calculus cleaner

#### 🔄 **Connection to Gradient Descent**

**From the instructor**: *"The mean is halved (1/2) as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the 1/2 term."*

**What this means for beginners:**
- **Gradient Descent** is the algorithm we'll learn next that actually finds the minimum
- When we take derivatives (calculus), squared terms give us a factor of 2
- The 1/2 cancels this 2, making our equations much cleaner
- **Result**: Simpler math when finding the best θ₀ and θ₁ values

**Don't worry if this seems advanced** - the key point is that 1/2 makes the optimization algorithm work more smoothly!

#### 🔄 **Other Options Exist**

While squared error is most common, there are alternatives:
- **Mean Absolute Error**: Σ|h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾|
- **Huber Loss**: Combination of squared and absolute error
- **Custom Functions**: For specific problem requirements

*We'll explore these alternatives later in the course!*

### 🎯 What's Next?

Now that we understand **what** the cost function is, the next questions are:

1. **How do we actually minimize J(θ₀, θ₁)?**
2. **What does this cost function look like visually?**
3. **How do we find the minimum efficiently?**

These questions lead us to **Gradient Descent** - the algorithm that actually finds the best parameters!

### 💡 Key Insights

#### **🎯 The Core Problem**
- We need to choose θ₀ and θ₁ to make good predictions
- "Good" means close to actual house prices in our training set

#### **📏 The Measurement Tool**  
- Cost function J(θ₀, θ₁) measures how "bad" our parameters are
- Lower cost = better fit to training data

#### **🎛️ The Optimization Goal**
- Find θ₀ and θ₁ that minimize J(θ₀, θ₁)  
- This gives us the "best" straight line through our data

#### **🧮 The Mathematical Approach**
- Use squared errors to measure badness
- Average over all training examples
- Result: smooth function we can minimize
