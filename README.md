## Machine Learning – Course Notes and Assets

Welcome to this repository of beginner‑friendly machine learning notes, figures, and supporting scripts. Each module focuses on one topic and is written to be clear, visual, and practical.

## 📚 Modules

- [Module 1 – Supervised Learning: Introduction](Module%201/README.md)
  - High‑level overview, terminology, and first examples

- [Module 2 – Linear Regression with One Variable](Module%202/README.md)
  - Hypothesis: $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$
  - Cost function $J(\theta_0,\theta_1)$ and gradient descent
  - 3D bowl, contour plots, and “algorithm in action” visuals

- [Module 3 – Linear Algebra Review](Module%203/readme.md)
  - Matrices and vectors, sizes, indexing, and set notation $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$

## 🔎 How to navigate

- Open a module’s README to view lecture notes, figures, and links.
- Many figures are generated by small Python scripts inside each module’s `scripts/` folder. Run them with:

```bash
python path/to/script.py
```

## 🧩 Requirements (for figure generation)

Some scripts use standard libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. If you plan to regenerate images, create a virtual environment and install commonly used packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## 💡 Contributing / Updating

- Keep explanations simple and consistent across modules.
- Prefer GitHub‑friendly math: inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$`.
- When adding images, save them under the module’s `images/` directory and reference them with relative paths.
